## System Master Companion Guide

The TSCP Framework is a tensor-based "Organization Game" for complex systems.

## Key Metrics
- **Isotropy (Jaccard Index):** Measures structural similarity. If two systems have a Jaccard score of 1.0, they are isomorphic.
- **Phase Distance (Cosine Similarity):** Measures alignment of intentions. Identifies if two systems share the same "energy" despite different structures.

## Germination Process
1. **Load:** Import a G=1 Seed (Semantic Seed).
2. **Grow:** Apply a "Structuring Question" (SPARQL) to unfold the seed into a full state-space representation.
3. **Analyze:** Evaluate Antifragility and Entropy thresholds.
