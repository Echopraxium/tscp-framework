# TSCP Project Genesis: Conceptual Evolution

## Overview
The Transdisciplinary System Construction Principles (TSCP) framework is the result of a multi-stage conceptual evolution, moving from abstract systemic observation to a formalized tensor-based engine.

## Conceptual Core 1: The Observer and the State-Space
Initially focused on the relationship between an entity and its representation. The core idea was that no system exists independently of the observer (M2). The first "seeds" were identified as points in a potential state-space.

## Conceptual Core 2: Antifragility and Systemic Health
Integration of Nassim Taleb's Antifragility. The framework evolved to not only map systems but to evaluate their capacity to thrive under stress. This introduced the need for M3 Invariant laws.

## Conceptual Core 3: Semantic Unification
Transition to the Semantic Web (RDF/JSON-LD). This stage resolved the problem of heterogeneous data by using ontologies to create a "Rosetta Stone" for complex systems.

## Conceptual Core 4: Tensor Algebra (Current)
The final stage of the genesis: using multidimensional arrays (Tensors) to quantify the qualitative. This allows for the mathematical "growth" (germination) of systems through projection and similarity metrics.
