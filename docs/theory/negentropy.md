# M2 Layer Formalization: Negentropy

## 1. Definition
Negentropy (J) is the structural energy and information flux used by the Agent (M2) to maintain and increase system coherence. It is the direct constructive counterpart to Entropy (S).

## 2. Mathematical Expression
Within the Plexus (M2), the Agent operates the Representation Functor (Φ) to counteract dissipation:
J = -S + Φ

## 3. Operational Role
In the TSCP framework, Negentropy is the active output of the M2 layer. It ensures that the system trajectory (Path) remains aligned with the intended Attractor despite analytic noise or environmental entropy.
