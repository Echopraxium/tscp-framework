# Reference Bibliography: State of the Art & TSCP Positioning

This bibliography lists the theoretical frameworks and prior works that have influenced or border upon the TSCP (Theory of Structural/Constructive Projection) architecture. It helps situate the innovation of TSCP (the Analytic/Constructive vector dichotomy) in relation to existing standards.

## 1. Epistemological Foundations (The Truth Criterion)
*Why TSCP claims to be falsifiable and distinguishes the Model from Reality.*

* **Popper, K.** (1959). *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*. Hutchinson.
    * *TSCP Relevance:* Validates the scientific approach of M3 (Falsifiable Laws) and distinguishes the metaphysical framework from the scientific framework.
* **Korzybski, A.** (1933). *Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics*. International Non-Aristotelian Library.
    * *TSCP Relevance:* Primary source of the axiom "The map is not the territory," formalized in TSCP by the divergence between the Analytic Projector ($P_A$) and the Constructive Projector ($P_C$).

## 2. Systemics & Cybernetics (The Observer)
*Why TSCP integrates the Observer into the equation.*

* **Von Foerster, H.** (2003). *Understanding Understanding: Essays on Cybernetics and Cognition*. Springer.
    * *TSCP Relevance:* Second-order cybernetics. Justifies the inclusion of the observer (Analytic) as an integral part of the observed system.
* **Ashby, W. R.** (1956). *An Introduction to Cybernetics*. Chapman & Hall.
    * *TSCP Relevance:* Law of Requisite Variety. Fundamental for understanding the Information ($|I\rangle$) and Regulation invariants within M2.

## 3. Formal Systems Engineering (Structure & Dynamics)
*Methodological competitors for modeling.*

* **Dori, D.** (2002). *Object-Process Methodology: A Holistic Systems Paradigm*. Springer. (ISO 19450 Standard).
    * *TSCP Relevance:* The framework closest to TSCP, unifying Object (Structure) and Process (Dynamics). TSCP distinguishes itself from OPM by adding the explicit Semantic/Observer dimension.
* **Friedenthal, S., Moore, A., & Steiner, R.** (2014). *A Practical Guide to SysML: The Systems Modeling Language*. Morgan Kaufmann.
    * *TSCP Relevance:* The current industrial standard. Serves as a comparison point to demonstrate how TSCP simplifies complexity via its 4 fundamental vectors.

## 4. Physics of Information (Theoretical Cousins)
*Approaches attempting to define the "Physics of the Possible".*

* **Deutsch, D., & Marletto, C.** (2015). *Constructor theory of information*. Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 471(2174).
    * *TSCP Relevance:* "Counterfactual" approach (what is possible/impossible). Very close to the TSCP M3 layer (Substrate) and the notion of Constructive Transformation.

## 5. Invention & Heuristics (Classification)
*Precursors to the M2 Periodic Table.*

* **Altshuller, G.** (1984). *Creativity as an Exact Science*. Gordon and Breach.
    * *TSCP Relevance:* Creator of TRIZ. Major inspiration for the systematic and "chemical" approach to innovation (M2: Table of Invariants), although TRIZ is focused on technical resolution while TSCP focuses on universal ontology.
