# Annex B: Systemic Architect’s Guide
## Deriving M2 Invariants from the M3 Hilbert Substrate

In the TSCP framework, every concept in the **M2 Periodic Table** is a vector $|\psi\rangle$ within the **M3 Hilbert Space**. The M3 base is defined by four orthonormal vectors: $|S\rangle$ (Structure), $|I\rangle$ (Information), $|D\rangle$ (Dynamics), and $|T\rangle$ (Teleonomy). 

The coordinates (Tensor Signatures) assigned to M2 invariants represent the projection amplitudes of these four dimensions. Below are 5 canonical examples of how these derivations are constructed to ensure ontological consistency.

### 1. The "Agent" (m2:Agent)
**Signature:** `[ S:0.3 | I:0.2 | D:0.3 | T:0.2 ]`  
**Dirac:** $0.3|S\rangle + 0.2|I\rangle + 0.3|D\rangle + 0.2|T\rangle$

* **Derivation Logic:** An Agent is the most balanced systemic invariant.
    * **Structure (0.3):** It possesses a physical or topological boundary.
    * **Information (0.2):** It maintains internal state, memory, or processing.
    * **Dynamics (0.3):** It is capable of action and state transformation.
    * **Teleonomy (0.2):** It follows an internal objective or "will."
* **Architect's Note:** If you reduce $T$ to 0, the Agent becomes a **Component**. If you maximize $T$ and $I$, it evolves into a **Strategist**.

### 2. The "Rule" (m2:Rule)
**Signature:** `[ S:0.0 | I:0.7 | D:0.0 | T:0.3 ]`  
**Dirac:** $0.7|I\rangle + 0.3|T\rangle$

* **Derivation Logic:** A Rule is a purely **Analytic** construct.
    * **Information (0.7):** Its essence is a symbolic constraint or code.
    * **Teleonomy (0.3):** A Rule is never neutral; it exists to direct the system toward a specific attractor or to maintain a specific order.
    * **Structure/Dynamics (0.0):** In its pure form, a Rule has no mass and no inherent movement; it is a weightless informational constraint.

### 3. The "Resource" (m2:Resource)
**Signature:** `[ S:0.5 | I:0.0 | D:0.5 | T:0.0 ]`  
**Dirac:** $0.5|S\rangle + 0.5|D\rangle$

* **Derivation Logic:** A Resource is the "fuel" of the **Constructive** subspace.
    * **Structure (0.5):** It must be localized or stored (Stock potential).
    * **Dynamics (0.5):** It carries the potential for work or energy release (Flow potential).
    * **Information/Teleonomy (0.0):** A raw resource is passive; it does not "know" or "want" anything.

### 4. The "Language" (m2:Language)
**Signature:** `[ S:0.3 | I:0.7 | D:0.0 | T:0.0 ]`  
**Dirac:** $0.3|S\rangle + 0.7|I\rangle$

* **Derivation Logic:** Language is the vehicle of meaning.
    * **Information (0.7):** Its primary function is the transmission of symbols and semantics.
    * **Structure (0.3):** Language requires a physical substrate or a syntax (a structured arrangement of signs) to exist. Without structure, information collapses into white noise.

### 5. The "Attractor" (m2:Attractor)
**Signature:** `[ S:0.0 | I:0.0 | D:0.0 | T:1.0 ]`  
**Dirac:** $1.0|T\rangle$

* **Derivation Logic:** The Attractor is the "Pure Goal" or "Final Cause" of the system.
    * **Teleonomy (1.0):** It represents the singularity toward which all trajectories converge. It is the mathematical limit of the system's intent.
* **Architect's Note:** The Attractor is a theoretical limit. In M0 instances, it is used to define the "North Star" that governs the behavior of Agents and Regulations.
