# SDAP Legacy Core: The Atomic Foundation of TSCP

## 1. Executive Summary
This document distills the essential logic of SDAP 3.0 (System Design Atomic Principles) into the TSCP framework. It transitions from a static taxonomy of 64 principles to a generative periodic table of systems.

## 2. The 23 Orthogonal Operators (M3 Invariants)
These operators are the fundamental "quantum numbers" used by the TSCP engine to generate systemic isotopes.

### 2.1 The Seven Original Operators
- Identity: Defining the boundary and essence of a system.
- Perspective: The observer-dependent view of the system.
- Polarity: Essential dualities (In/Out, Source/Sink).
- Relation: Connectivity and interaction protocols.
- Containment: Nested hierarchies and boundaries.
- Feedback: Information loops and control mechanisms.
- Transformation: State changes and evolutionary processes.

### 2.2 Physical and Topological Operators
- Physical: Energy, Quantity, Vector, Spatiality, Conservation, Efficiency, Geometry, Threshold, Mode.
- Topological: Convergence/Divergence, Path (Trajectoires), Layered Architecture (Stratification).
- Strategic (TRIZ): Resource, Ideality, Contradiction.

## 3. The 4x4x4 Cube (The Meta-Model)
Principles are arranged along three axes, defining the "coordinates" of any systemic atom:
1. Scale: Micro to Macro.
2. Rate of Change: Static to Hyper-dynamic.
3. Predictability: Deterministic to Chaotic.



## 4. Isotope Theory (The Generative Engine)
TSCP uses the operators to create "Isotopes" from base principles. This is the heart of the 'grow' command.
- Colinear Isotopes: Translation across scales (Fractal consistency).
- Symmetric Isotopes: Exploration of dualities (Antifragility vs Fragility).
- Isomorphic Isotopes: Cross-domain projection (e.g., biological mycelium logic applied to P2P networks).

## 5. Validation Metrics
The legacy validation suggests a 90% predictive power for systems modeled with these 23 operators. TSCP aims to automate this validation via Tensor signatures.
