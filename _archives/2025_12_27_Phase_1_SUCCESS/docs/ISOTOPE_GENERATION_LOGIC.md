# TSCP: Isotope Generation & Tensor Projections

## Overview
Based on SDAP 3.0, the TSCP engine does not just store principles; it generates "Isotopes" (variations) using operators.

## 1. The 23 Operators (M3 Level)
These operators act as the "Quantum Numbers" of our systemic elements.
- Primary: Identity, Perspective, Polarity, Relation, Containment, Feedback, Transformation.
- Physical: Energy, Quantity, Vector, Spatiality, Conservation, Efficiency, Geometry, Threshold, Mode.
- Strategic/TRIZ: Resource, Ideality, Contradiction.

## 2. Isotope Types for the TensorEngine
When the 'grow' command is called, the engine can project three types of isotopes:
1. Colinear (Scale): Changing the scale (e.g., from a local market to global).
2. Symmetric (Duality): Reversing a principle (e.g., Centralization vs Decentralization).
3. Isomorphic (Domain): Translating a biological principle into a financial one.

## 3. Mathematical Validation
A principle is validated if its "Tensor Signature" remains coherent across domain translations.
