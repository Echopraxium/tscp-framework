# Systemic Architect Companion Guide

## Introduction
This guide defines the mathematical and conceptual foundations of the TSCP Framework. Its purpose is to provide a formal basis that can be audited, criticized, and improved by third parties.

## 1. Formal Ontology and Stratification
The framework operates on a four-level metalevel architecture (M3 to M0). This ensures that universal laws (M3) remain decoupled from specific observations (M0). Any systemic analysis must be traceable back to an M3 Invariant to be considered valid within this protocol.

## 2. Mathematical Foundation: Tensor Algebra
To compare disparate systems (e.g., a financial market and a biological forest), TSCP uses Tensor Algebra as a translation layer.

### 2.1 State-Space Representation
Each system (Seed) is projected as a tensor in a multi-dimensional semantic space. 
- Dimensions are defined by M1 Standards.
- Coordinates are derived from M0 Instance data.

### 2.2 Semantic Distance and Similarity
The proximity between two systems is not measured by surface data, but by their structural resonance.
- Tensor Projections: We use multi-linear maps to project systems into lower-dimensional spaces for comparative analysis.
- Metrics: The primary metrics used are Jaccard Similarity for categorical tags and Cosine Similarity for weighted energy vectors.

## 3. The Pillar of Antifragility
Antifragility is formally defined here as a non-linear response to stressors. In the TSCP context, a system is labeled Antifragile if its state-space volume increases or stabilizes in response to high-entropy inputs.

### 3.1 Verification and Audit
By using RDF (Resource Description Framework) and Triple Stores, every mathematical claim made by the TensorEngine is backed by a verifiable chain of semantic triples. Third parties can audit the logic by:
1. Verifying the M3 ruleset.
2. Inspecting the M1 projection matrices.
3. Re-calculating the M0 tensor coordinates.

## 4. Methodological Rigor
- Determinism: Given the same input seeds and M3-M1 rules, the TensorEngine must produce identical similarity scores.
- Critically: The framework is designed to be "Open-Logic." Any observer (M2) can propose a new M1 Standard to view the data from a different systemic angle.
