# TSCP Framework (Trans-Systemic Conservation Protocol)

## Overview
The TSCP Framework is a semantic engine designed to model and analyze complex systems through the lens of State-Space representation and Antifragility. It provides a standardized method to map heterogeneous systems (from financial market squeezes to biological ecosystems) into a common semantic space using Tensor Algebra.

## Core Pillars
1. State-Space Representation: Mapping entities as multi-dimensional points in a formal semantic environment.
2. Antifragility: Measuring a system's capacity to thrive under volatility using specific semantic metrics.
3. TensorEngine: Calculating semantic distances and projections between systems.

## Architecture
The framework follows a strict 4-layer stratification:
- M3 (Invariant): Universal laws and foundational concepts (e.g., Entropy).
- M2 (Observer): Intent, measurement perspective, and observer roles.
- M1 (Standard): Shared protocols, languages, and models.
- M0 (Instance): Real-world systems and raw datasets (Seeds).

## Project Standards and Guidelines
- Language: All technical artifacts, code comments, documentation files, and metadata are strictly written in English to ensure global interoperability.
- Style: Documentation and README files must maintain a professional and sober tone. The use of smileys, emojis, or icons is prohibited.
- Technical Delivery: Text-based documents (.txt, .md) must be provided in a format that facilitates direct copy-pasting.
- File Generation: Preference is given to providing complete files. If a file is too large, the assistant will request permission before generating partial segments.

## Getting Started
- Language: F# / .NET 10.0
- Semantic Engine: dotNetRDF 3.x
- Build: Use `dotnet run --project src/TSCP.CLI` to launch the interactive shell.

## Contact and Contributions
Development is currently in Phase 2 (Germination). Please refer to the docs/reboot folder for the latest session snapshots and technical state.
