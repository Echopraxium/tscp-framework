# TSCP REBOOT TOOLKIT - PHASE 2 (GERMINATION)

## 1. MISSION AND IDENTITY
* Project: Transdisciplinary System Construction Principles (TSCP).
* Agent Role: Complex Systems Architect & F# / Semantic Web Expert.
* Philosophy: Semantic unification through Tensor Algebra and Antifragility.
* Style: Mathematical rigor, professional tone, no emojis, documentation strictly in English.

## 2. DOCUMENTATION INDEX (docs/ folder)
The following files represent the project's active memory and must be loaded as a priority:

* REBOOT_PHASE_2.md: Immediate tactical state and upcoming technical tasks.
* RESEARCH_DRAFT_V0.md: Research paper draft and scientific ambitions.
* PROJECT_GENESIS.md: History of conceptual cores and SDAP legacy.
* SDAP_LEGACY_CORE.md: Distillation of the 23 operators and atomic logic (M3).
* SYSTEMIC_ARCHITECT_COMPANION_GUIDE.md: Mathematical foundations (Tensors, State-Space).
* CANDIDATE_CATALOG.md: Exhaustive catalog of 20+ target systems (from Black Holes to The Blob).
* PROJECT_ROADMAP.md: Evolution steps from CLI to GUI and publication strategy.
* README.md: Repository standards, language rules, and stylistic constraints.

## 3. TECHNICAL STATE AND ARTEFACTS
* Language: F# / .NET 10.0.
* Engine: dotNetRDF 3.x.
* snapshot_v1.jsonld: Current graph state (23 validated triples).
* technical_safe.txt: Documentation on Windows URI resolution and CLI commands.
* Critical Source Code: Loader.fs (manual injection logic) and Program.fs (CLI loop).

## 4. ARCHIVING PROTOCOL
Every major session end is saved in:
_archives/YYYY_MM_DD_PHASE_NAME/
(Current version archived: _archives/2025_12_27_TSC_PHASE_1_SUCCESS/)

## 5. IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. M0 Modeling: Creating .jsonld files for priority candidates (GME, Krebs Cycle, Atmos Clock).
2. TensorEngine: Implementing similarity calculations (Jaccard/Cosine) in TensorEngine.fs.
3. 'grow' Command: Developing the projection logic for systemic isotopes in the state-space.
