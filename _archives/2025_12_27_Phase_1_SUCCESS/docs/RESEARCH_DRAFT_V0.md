# RESEARCH DRAFT V0: Transdisciplinary System Construction Principles (TSCP)

## Title
TSCP: A Semantic Meta-Framework for Cross-Domain Systemic Integration based on Transdisciplinary System Construction Principles.

## Abstract
This paper introduces the Transdisciplinary System Construction Principles (TSCP) framework, a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between disparate complex systems (financial, biological, and technical). By utilizing a four-layer stratified ontology (M3-M0) and Tensor Algebra, TSCP allows for the projection of heterogeneous "Seeds" into a unified State-Space. We demonstrate the technical feasibility of this approach through a functional engine implemented in F#, capable of performing semantic unification and cross-system similarity analysis. Initial results show that the integration of Antifragility metrics within an RDF-based graph enables a robust quantification of systemic health across varied environments.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing complexity of global systems demands a unified language for cross-domain analysis. The Transdisciplinary System Construction Principles (TSCP) address this by providing a formal method to store, compare, and "grow" systemic knowledge, moving beyond traditional database models to capture invariant laws governing system evolution.

## 2. Methodology
The research methodology is built on two pillars:

### 2.1 Stratified Semantic Architecture
- M3 (Invariant): Definition of universal systemic laws.
- M2 (Observer): Formalization of the observer's perspective and measurement intent.
- M1 (Standard): Normalization of domain-specific protocols.
- M0 (Instance): Ingestion of real-world data points (Seeds).

### 2.2 Mathematical Engine
The engine uses Tensor Algebra to handle multi-dimensional relationships. By projecting semantic triples into a vector space, we can calculate the "Semantic Distance" between systems that appear unrelated on the surface.

## 3. Technical Implementation
- Implementation Language: F# (for type safety and functional paradigm).
- Semantic Core: dotNetRDF for triple-store management and JSON-LD parsing.
- Current Status: Phase 1 (Foundation) completed. The engine successfully ingests 23 foundational triples, linking universal invariants to specific instances.

## 4. Discussion and Future Work
Future research will focus on the "Germination" phase, where the TensorEngine will calculate the evolutionary trajectory of systems based on their Antifragility scores. We aim to prove that systemic construction can be mathematically modeled and predicted through this semantic projection.
