# TSCP Project Roadmap

## Phase 2: Germination (Current)
- CLI Enhancement: Implementation of the 'grow' command.
- Logic: Integration of the TensorEngine (Jaccard/Cosine similarity).
- Goal: First successful similarity report between two M0 Seeds.

## Phase 3: Prototyping and GUI
- Specification: Design of a visual interface to map the State-Space.
- Technology: Selection of a lightweight framework (e.g., Fable/Elmish or Avalonia) for F#.
- Goal: A 2D/3D visualization of the semantic graph and systemic clusters.

## Phase 4: Research and Publication
- Paper Drafting: Completion of the research article based on RESEARCH_DRAFT_V0.md.
- Strategy for Independent Researchers:
    - Target: Open-access journals or transdisciplinary conferences (e.g., Systems Thinking or Complexity Science).
    - Pre-print: Upload to arXiv or OSF to establish priority.
    - Peer Review: Leveraging the formal auditability of the TSCP code.

## Phase 5: Framework Scalability
- Expansion of the Seed Catalog.
- Automation of M1 Standard creation via AI-assisted tagging.
