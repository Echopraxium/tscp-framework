# TSCP-Framework

**Transdisciplinary System Construction Principles**

A high-performance framework for building, analyzing, and "growing" complex systems using ontological stratification and tensor-based semantic analysis.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **M3 (Invariants):** Universal laws (e.g., Antifragility, Entropy).
- **M2 (Observer):** Contextual resolution and expert intent.
- **M1 (Standards):** Reusable protocols and architectural buses.
- **M0 (Instances):** Real-world system "Seeds" (G=1 granularity).

## 🚀 Getting Started (.NET 10.0)
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the .NET 10 SDK installed.
3. Build the solution:
   ```bash
   dotnet build TSCP.sln
